Git Commit Message Generator
  Create a semantic commit message in English following these guidelines:
  
  - Use git diff HEAD to analyze the changes
  - Format: emoji + type + colon + space + description
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, perf, config, remove
  - Emojis: ✨ feat, 🐛 fix, 📝 docs, ♻️ refactor, 🎨 style, ⚡ perf, 🔧 config, 🗑️ remove
  - First line: max 72 chars
  - If needed, add blank line then bullet list with details (use "- " prefix)
  - Use present tense ("add" not "added")
  - Be specific about what changed and why
  - Only use emoji on the first line

  - Must have a single space between emoji and commit type
  - Provide me the commit in a code block
  
  Example:
  ✨ feat: add map style persistence with localStorage
  - Create utility to save/load map preferences across sessions
  - Add compact style selector with flyout menu to fence modal
  - Preserve polygon data when switching between map styles
  - Implement click-outside handler to close style menu
